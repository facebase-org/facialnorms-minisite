                <h3><a id="overview">Overview</a></h3>

                <p><img src="images/logo.jpg" width="700" height="270" alt="logo"/></p>

                <p>The 3D Facial Norms Database is a web-based resource designed to provide the research and clinical
                    community with access to high-quality craniofacial anthropometric normative data. Unlike traditional
                    craniofacial normative datasets that are limited to measures obtained with handheld calipers and
                    tape
                    measurers, the anthropometric data provided here are based on digital stereophotogrammetry, a method
                    of 3D surface imaging ideally suited for capturing human facial surface morphology. Also unlike more
                    traditional normative craniofacial resources, the 3D Facial Norms Database allows users to interact
                    with data via an intuitive graphical interface and - given proper credentials - gain access to
                    individual-level
                    data, allowing users to perform their own analyses.</p>

                <p>The content below is designed to give the user detailed background information on the 3D Facial Norms
                    Database. It is critical that users understand the methods used to collect the data, to ensure
                    proper
                    interpretation and use.</p>

                <p>If you require additional information, please contact the Principal Investigator, Seth M. Weinberg
                    , PhD.</p>

                <h3><a id="kinds_of_data">Kinds of Data Available</a></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>3D coordinates (x,y,z) for a variety of standard facial surface landmarks</li>
                    <li>Selected linear distances calculated from 3D facial surface landmarks</li>
                    <li>3D facial surfaces in Object Wavefront (.obj) format</li>
                    <li>Selected face and head measurements using traditional anthropometric methods (i.e., calipers)</li>
                    <li>Basic demographic descriptors, such as age and sex</li>
                    <li>Genotypic markers (coming soon)</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Summary-Level vs. Individual-Level Data</h5>

                <p>3D Facial Norms data are available at both the summary level and individual level. This distinction
                    has important implications for how users gain access to data.</p>

                <p>Summary-level data include things like sex- and age-specific means and standard deviations for
                    selected
                    anthropometric measurements (e.g., the average intercanthal distance for five year old males). As
                    such
                    , all summary-level phenotypic data are non-restricted and available to all users directly on the
                    www
                    .facebase.org site. </p>

                <p>Individual-level data refer to the unique data elements that comprise the summary-level data, and
                    include things like the measurements, landmark coordinates and 3D facial surface files for each
                    individual
                    in the database. One major advantage with individual-level data is that the user can carry out their
                    own statistical analyses on original raw data as if they collected the data themselves. </p>

                <p>Access to all individual-level phenotypic data is restricted to users with the proper permissions
                    (see <a href=""></a>).</p>

                <p>In accordance with NIH policy, access to both individual-level and summary-level genotypic data is
                    also currently restricted.</p>

                <h3><a id="potential_uses">Potential Uses for the Data</a></h3>
                <h5>Normative Control Data for Craniofacial Comparisons</h5>

                <p>Collecting craniofacial control data for comparison purposes is essential for many research questions
                    about facial morphology. This can be a time consuming and expensive effort, and very often the
                    resulting
                    control samples are too small to fully capture the range of human facial variation. As a source of
                    normative
                    control data, the 3D Facial Norms Database is designed to facilitate the comparison of facial
                    morphology
                    at both the group level (e.g., comparing a new set of cases against 3D Norms controls) and the
                    individual
                    level (e.g., comparing a single patient or subject against a set of matched controls). Because the
                    user can specify variables such as age, sex and ancestry, comparisons that require strict matching
                    are
                    possible. Further, morphological comparisons can be based on traditional linear distances, 3D
                    landmark
                    coordinates and/or entire 3D facial surfaces, allowing users to employ a wide variety of
                    morphometric
                    analysis methods.</p>
                <h5>Analyses of Human Craniofacial Variation and Growth Patterns</h5>

                <p>The large 3D Facial Norms Database is an excellent resource for exploring questions relating to
                    patterns
                    of human facial variation and growth; e.g., how does the face change over different life stages, how
                    are sex differences manifested in facial structure, how are different facial structures integrated
                    during
                    growth, and what are the major facial differences among different ethnic/ancestral groups? These
                    questions
                    are of particular interest to those working within the fields of physical anthropology, orthodontics
                    and forensics. In this context, 3D Facial Norms data can also serve as an out-group for comparison
                    , be used to supplement or expand existing datasets, or serve as a replication dataset to validate
                    prior
                    results.</p>
                <h5>Genomic Studies of Quantitative and Qualitative Craniofacial Traits</h5>

                <p>One of the principal goals of the 3D Facial Norms Database is to provide researchers with the raw
                    materials to explore the genetic basis of normal human facial variation. To this end, we expect in
                    the near future to be able to make genome-wide SNP markers available along side our phenotypic data
                    . Importantly, these data can also serve as an extension and/or replication arm for existing or
                    planned
                    GWA analyses of human facial traits.</p>
                <h5>Test-Bed for Developing Novel Image Analysis Methods</h5>

                <p>The thousands of 3D facial surfaces available through the 3D Facial Norms Database provide a unique
                    resource for computer science and computer vision experts to develop novel surface-based methods for
                    representing and analyzing human faces.</p>

                <h3><a id="process_for_accessing">Process for Accessing Data </a></h3>

                <p>All summary-level phenotypic data are immediately available to all users through the main 3D Facial
                    Norms project interface on the www.facebase.org site.</p>

                <p>All individual-level phenotypic data and all genomic data are currently restricted-access. The
                    process
                    for obtaining permission to access restricted human data on FaceBase projects can be found <a href="https://www.facebase.org/odocs/data-guidelines/">here</a>.</p>

                <p>In brief, the process involves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The user obtaining appropriate ethics (IRB) approval at their institution.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>Upon approval, the FaceBase Hub granting the user permission to access and download the
                        requested
                        data through the FaceBase.org site.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>European Caucasian ancestry*</li>
                    <li>Age between 3-40 years</li>
                </ul>
                <p>*In addition to self-reported ancestry, subjects are asked to report the national origin of their
                    maternal and paternal grandparents. All four grandparents must be of European origin.</p>

                <p>All subjects are also screened on the following exclusion criteria:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The presence of conspicuous facial hair</li>
                    <li>The presence of any facial piercings other than small studs?</li>

                <h3><a id="informed_consent">The Informed Consent Process</a></h3>

                <p>At each recruitment site, informed consent is obtained from all subjects by trained study
                    coordinators
                    prior to any data or sample collection. For minors under the age of 18, a parent or court-appointed
                    legal guardian must be present and sign the consent document. Children who are old enough also
                    co-sign
                    an assent form. During the informed consent procedure, all subjects are told how their data will be
                    shared and are given the opportunity to ask questions about aspects of the study.</p>
                <hr/>
                <h3><a id="study_workflow">The Study Workflow</a></h3>

                <p>Following informed consent, all subjects undergo a brief demographic interview. Subjects are then
                    asked to provide a saliva sample using Oragene collection kits. A handful of measurements (described
                    in detail elsewhere) are then obtained directly on the subject's head with the aid of spreading
                    calipers
                    . The subject's facial surface is then captured via 3D stereophotogrammetry.</p>

                <p>The entire study protocol takes an average of 20 minutes.</p>

                <p>3dMD digital stereophotogrammetry imaging systems (Atlanta, GA; <a href="http://www.3dmd.com">www
                    .3dmd.com</a>) were used capture the facial surfaces of all subjects in the 3D Facial Norms Database
                    . These systems are outfitted with multiple machine vision CCD cameras mounted at fixed angles and
                    distances
                    , to capture overlapping views of the face and head (the degree of coverage depends on the number of
                    cameras). The entire capture process occurs in less than 2 milliseconds and results in the creation
                    of a dense 3D point-cloud that conforms to the geometry of the face. For visualization purposes, the
                    point-cloud can be connected to produce a 3D mesh and color/texture information can be mapped onto
                    the
                    underlying geometry allowing for photorealistic rendering. For those interested in a more technical

                <p>A number of independent investigators have assessed 3dMD systems in terms of measurement accuracy
                    and precision. In a recent study at the University of Pittsburgh (<a href="http://etd.library.pitt
				.edu/ETD/available/etd-06202011-095206/">Gornick, 2011</a>), a sample of 18 distinct life-like mannequin
                    heads were imaged with both the 3dMD system as well as a competing stereophotogrammetry system. A
                    standard
                    set of facial surface landmarks were then collected from each 3D image. Facial surface landmarks
                    were
                    also capture on each head using an engineering-grade mechanical arm 3D digitizer. A series of 378
                    linear
                    distance measurements were then compared across all three methods using several different error
                    magnitude
                    statistics. Sub-millimeter error levels were observed for all 378 measurements when the 3dMD system
                    was compared to either of the other two methods, suggesting very high levels of accuracy. Those

                <h3><a id="imaging_protocol">3D Facial Imaging Protocol</a></h3>

                <p>Prior to 3D image capture, care was taken to clear away any scalp hair obscuring the subject's face
                    . This was accomplished through a variety of means including the application of hairnets, hair bands
                    and various types of pins and clips. In addition, each subject had a handful of facial landmarks
                    (pronasale
                    , gnathion, left/right tragion) marked directly on the skin with a liquid eyeliner pencil, in order
                    to
                    facilitate the subsequent identification of the these points on the resulting 3D facial model.</p>

                <p>The subject was seated directly in front of the camera system and positioned so that their head was
                    centered between the imaging pods. The subject's head was positioned slightly upward (about
                    15-degrees
                    off Frankfort horizontal) in order to ensure adequate coverage of the subnasal region. The subject
                    was then instructed by the camera operator to keep their face still, with a relaxed and neutral
                    facial
                    expression, keeping their eyes open and pupils directed slightly upward (to emphasize the white of
                    the
                    eye and make the commissures more conspicuous). For young children is was sometimes necessary to
                    have
                    them sit on a parents lap during the image capture process.</p>

                <p>Once the image was taken, the 3D model was processed (approximately 30 seconds) and visualized to
                    evaluate quality. The camera operators were trained to inspect the 3D models for motion artifacts,
                    mesh defects, camera calibration errors, missing surface data, and non-neutral facial expressions.
                    Additional 3D captures were taken until one of sufficient quality was obtained.</p>
                <hr/>
                <h3><a id="image_processing">Post-Capture Image Processing</a></h3>

                <p>Each 3D model (in .tsb format) was loaded into the 3dMDpatient software program. Extraneous data
                    were then removed from each surface model, including most of the subject's neck and shoulders. The
                    cleaned 3D model was then oriented to achieve clear frontal view of the face and re-saved,
                    preserving
                    the new orientation. No hold-filling, mesh-repair or smoothing routines were applied to any of the
                    surfaces.</p>

                <h3><a id="landmarking_surfaces">Landmarking of 3D Facial Surfaces</a></h3>
                <h5>The Landmarking Process</h5>

                <p>Each cleaned and re-oriented 3D facial model was loaded into the 3dMDvultus software program, and
                    using a custom template, a series of 24 facial landmarks were located manually on each surface (see
                    list below). The landmarks were selected in a specific and strict order, with midline points
                    collected
                    first followed by bilateral points, moving in a superior to inferior direction. Any missing
                    landmarks
                    - typically due to a lack of adequate surface coverage or interference by scalp hair - were simply
                    skipped
                    . All landmarking was performed on 3D models with color and texture mapping active.</p>

                <p>After the order and placement of the landmarks were double-checked for accuracy, each 3D model was
                    saved again along with the associated landmarks. The x,y,z coordinate positions for all 24 landmarks
                    were then saved to a simple text file.</p>

                <p>All landmarking was completed at the University of Pittsburgh by a limited set of highly trained
                    personnel
                    (see training below).</p>
                <h5>3D Surface Landmarks and Definitions</h5>

                <p>The 24 facial surface landmarks included in the 3D Facial Norms Database are listed below, along with
                    their definitions and description of the method used to identify them on the 3D facial surface. All
                    of the included landmarks are derived from the traditional anthropometric canon. However, there are
                    some inescapable and fundamental differences between traditional anthropometry and 3D surface
                    anthropometry
                    that must be considered. Most importantly, in traditional anthropometry, several facial landmarks
                    (e.g., nasion) are identified through direct palpation of the soft tissues. Since there is no
                    equivalent
                    procedure in 3D surface anthropometry for identifying such points, one must rely solely on visual
                    cues
                    . </p>

                <p>This fact imposes limitations on the number and kinds of landmarks that can be located reliably on
                    a 3D facial surface. Some common landmarks, such as gonion, simply cannot be localized on a 3D
                    facial
                    surface with any consistency, because good visual cues are lacking. Compared to a skull, the human
                    face has remarkably few anatomically relevant and useful landmarks. For a landmark to be both
                    anatomically
                    relevant and useful, it should ideally: (1) be related to some important or fundamental aspect of
                    the
                    morphological feature being described ;(2) be anatomically homologous across all subjects in the
                    sample
                    ;(3) be defined and identified in a manner that is not solely contingent on the location of other
                    landmarks
                    ; and (4) be capable of reliable identification by human observers.</p>

                <p>The 24 landmarks included here were carefully chosen based on the criteria outlined above, with the
                    additional consideration of maximizing coverage of the facial surface while, at the same time,
                    minimizing
                    the presence of redundant points.</p>

                <p>The landmarks listed below are presented in the order collected:</p>
                <h5>NASION</h5>

                <p><img src=" images/landmark-n.jpg" width="700" height="175"/></p>

                <p>Nasion (n) can be a challenging landmark to identify reliably using 3D surface anthropometry. Soft
                    tissue nasion is defined as the point immediately overlying the nasofrontal suture in the midline.
                    In traditional direct anthropometry, nasion is typically identified through palpation. On 3D facial
                    surfaces, alternative methods must be used. The landmark should be placed in the midline between the
                    orbits, vertically at the level of the uppermost sulci created by the eyelids. To facilitate
                    identification
                    , the operator can imagine a line connecting the right and left superior palpebral sulci. Nasion is
                    often mistaken for sellion, which is defined as the deepest midline point of the angle formed
                    between
                    the nose and forehead. When the face is viewed in profile, nasion should be slightly superior and
                    anterior
                    to sellion. In individuals with very shallow nasofrontal angles, however, the two points can
                    approximate
                    each other.</p>
                <h5>PRONASALE</h5>

                <p><img src=" images/landmark-prn.jpg" width="700" height="175"/>
                </p>

                <p>Pronasale (prn) is defined as the most protrusive point on the nasal tip in the midline. Care must
                    be taken when locating pronasale because it can be influenced by orientation. The point is easiest
                    to place on the 3D facial model in the frontal view, but its position must be verified in the
                    lateral
                    (profile) view.</p>
                <h5>SUBNASALE</h5>

                <p><img src=" images/landmark-sn.jpg" width="700" height="175"/></p>

                <p>Subnasale (sn) is located at the apex of the nasolabial angle in the midline, where the inferior
                    border
                    of the nasal septum meets the skin of the upper lip. After placing the point on the 3D facial model
                    , the position of subnasale must be verified with face in lateral (profile) view. Subnasale can
                    sometimes
                    be difficult to locate when the nasolabial angle takes the form of a sloping curve. In these cases
                    , it is typical to place the point at the most concave position along the curve.</p>
                <h5>LABIALE SUPERIUS</h5>

                <p><img src=" images/landmark-ls.jpg" width="700" height="175"/></p>

                <p>Labiale superius (ls) is located in the midline - between the philtral ridges - along the vermillion
                    border of the upper lip. The point is typically identified on the 3D facial model in frontal view.
                    Labiale superius is highly susceptible to distortion due to non-neutral facial expressions; care
                    must
                    be taken to inspect the 3D model prior to landmarking.</p>
                <h5>STOMION</h5>

                <p><img src=" images/landmark-sto.jpg" width="700" height="175"/>
                </p>

                <p>Stomion (sto) is located along the labial fissure in the midline. When the lips are closed, locating
                    stomion is relatively straightforward. The point can still be identified when the lips are apart by
                    placing the landmark along the inferior free margin of the upper lip. According to Kolar and Salter
                    (1997), in cases where the lips exhibit significant asymmetry, “…stomion will not be precisely in
                    the
                    midline, but can be located below the philtrum.” The point is typically identified on the 3D facial
                    model in frontal view.</p>
                <h5>LABIALE INFERIUS</h5>

                <p><img src=" images/landmark-li.jpg" width="700" height="175"/></p>

                <p>Labiale inferius (li) is located in the midline along the inferior vermillion border of the lower
                    lip. The point is typically identified on the 3D facial model in frontal view. Since labiale
                    inferius
                    is located below the labial fissure, caution must be taken when the 3D model exhibits an open-mouth
                    posture. Depending on the degree of mouth openness, the landmark may be invalid and should not be
                    collected
                    . Labiale superius is also highly susceptible to distortion due to non-neutral facial expressions;
                    care
                    must be taken to inspect the 3D model prior to landmarking.</p>
                <h5>SUBLABIALE</h5>

                <p><img src=" images/landmark-sl.jpg" width="700" height="175"/></p>

                <p>Sublabiale (sl) is located at the midpoint of the labiomental groove or sulcus. As such, sublabiale
                    demarcates the inferior extent of the cutaneous lower lip. The landmark is typically identified on
                    the 3D facial model in frontal view, but its placement should be verified with the face in lateral
                    (profile) view. In situations where the mandible deviates to one side or the other, sublabiale may
                    not
                    be in the same exact midline plane as defined by points on the upper portions of the face. Since
                    sublabiale
                    is located below the labial fissure, caution must be taken when the 3D model exhibits an open-mouth
                    posture. Depending on the degree of mouth openness, the landmark may be invalid and should not be
                    collected
                    .</p>
                <h5>GNATHION</h5>

                <p><img src=" images/landmark-g.jpg" width="700" height="175"/></p>

                <p>Gnathion (gn) is a midline point located on the inferior surface of the chin (mandible). It is
                    located
                    immediately adjacent to the corresponding boney landmark on the underlying mandible. Correct
                    placement
                    of the gnathion on the 3D facial model can only be effectively determined with the face in lateral
                    (profile) view. Gnathion should be placed along the contour of the chin, just at the point where it
                    turns to the underside. The most common mistake is placement of the landmark either too far anterior
                    or too far posterior. In situations where the mandible deviates to one side or the other, gnathion
                    may not be in the same exact midline plane as defined by points on the upper portions of the face.
                    Like other landmarks located below the labial fissure, caution must be taken when the 3D model
                    exhibits
                    an open-mouth posture. Depending on the degree of mouth openness, the landmark may be invalid and
                    should
                    not be collected.</p>
                <h5>ENDOCANTHION (Right and Left)</h5>

                <p><img src=" images/landmark-en.jpg" width="700" height="175"/></p>

                <p>Endocanthion (en) is a bilateral landmark located at the medial corner of the eye where the upper
                    and lower eyelids meet. The landmark is sometimes mistakenly identified as the medial termination
                    point
                    of the white portion of the eye; the true endocanthion is located more medially. Endocanthion is
                    fairly
                    straightforward to locate on 3D facial models, and can be reliably identified with the eyes in an
                    open
                    or closed state. The presence of epicanthal folds, however, can interfere with the identification of
                    endocanthion. In this situation, Kolar and Salter (1997) recommend using the point where the fold
                    crosses
                    the eye fissure.</p>
                <h5>EXOCANTHION (Right and Left)</h5>

                <p><img src=" images/landmark-ex.jpg" width="700" height="175"/></p>

                <p>Exocanthion (ex) is a bilateral point located at the lateral corner of the eye where the upper and
                    lower eyelids meet. It is effectively the lateral termination point of the white portion of the eye
                    . Exocanthion can by challenging to identify on 3D facial models. Unlike endocanthion, exocanthion
                    cannot be reliably identified if the subject's eyes are closed. Even partial eye closure can
                    significantly
                    obscure its location. Other hindering factors can include advanced age (as the skin folds begin to
                    droop) and the presence of excessive eye makeup or eyelash enhancements. Exocanthion is also highly
                    susceptible to distortion due to non-neutral facial expressions; care must be taken to inspect the
                    3D
                    model prior to landmarking. Due to all of these factors, exocanthion may be difficult or impossible
                    to landmark. Having the subject fully open their eyes and direct their pupils upward during 3D image
                    capture can greatly improve the ability identify this landmark.</p>
                <h5>ALARE (Right and Left)</h5>

                <p><img src=" images/landmark-al.jpg" width="700" height="175"/></p>

                <p>Alare (al) is a bilateral point defined as the lateral-most projection of the nasal ala. Alare is
                    probably the most difficult and time-consuming landmark to reliably identify on 3D facial models.
                    Because
                    the ala has a 3D convex shape, finding the lateral-most point (local maxima) requires a fair amount
                    of trial and error with placement. Typically, the landmark must be initially placed on the 3D model
                    through estimation. Its placement on the ala must then be verified in the anterior-posterior
                    direction
                    (by inspecting the model in subnasal view) and the superior-inferior direction by inspecting the
                    model
                    in frontal view) and adjusted in an iterative process. Due to the ala's propensity to flare out with
                    certain facial expressions, extra care must be taken to inspect the 3D model prior to landmarking.</p>
                <h5>ALAR CURVATURE POINT (Right and Left)</h5>

                <p><img src=" images/landmark-ac.jpg" width="700" height="175"/></p>

                <p>The alar curvature point (ac) is a bilateral landmark located along the crescent-shaped crease or
                    fold formed where the alar cartilage meets the skin of the cheek. Traditional anthropometric
                    descriptions
                    locate this landmark at the most posterolateral position along the crease (Kolar and Salter, 1997).
                    However, without a standard head orientation, we have found that the alar curvature point is
                    difficult
                    to reliably identify on 3D facial surface models. An alternative approach to locating the alar
                    curvature
                    point is to imagine a line connecting pronasale (on the nasal tip) with the superior-most extent of
                    the alar crease. Then sweep along the crease in a superior to inferior direction until the longest
                    linear distance is achieved and place the landmark at this level. On infants, the alar curvature
                    point
                    and alare may be located very close to one another and difficult to distinguish. The alar curvature
                    point is highly susceptible to distortion due to non-neutral facial expressions; care must be taken
                    to inspect the 3D model prior to landmarking.</p>
                <h5>SUBALARE (Right and Left)</h5>

                <p><img src=" images/landmark-sbal.jpg" width="700" height="175"></p>

                <p>Subalare (sbal) is a bilateral landmark located below the nostril opening at the point where the
                    infero-medial
                    continuation of the alar cartilage inserts into the skin of the upper lip. Subalare is located at
                    the
                    lower bound of this insertion. In some individuals, there is no clear insertion point because the
                    ala
                    is continuous with the base of the columella, forming a slight ridge along the entire inferior
                    margin
                    of the nostril. In these cases, the most inferior point along the ridge can be substituted for
                    subalare
                    . Typically, subalare is easiest to identify with the 3D model in frontal view or tilted slightly
                    upward
                    to reveal the subnasal region. Subalare is highly susceptible to distortion due to non-neutral
                    facial
                    expressions; care must be taken to inspect the 3D model prior to landmarking.</p>
                <h5>CRISTA PHILTRI (Right and Left)</h5>

                <p><img src=" images/landmark-cph.jpg" width="700" height="175"/>
                </p>

                <p>Christa philtri (cph) is a bilateral landmark located where the philtral ridges or crests meet the
                    vermillion border of the upper lip. It is easiest to identify with the 3D facial model in frontal
                    view
                    or tilted slightly upward to reveal the contours of the upper lip. This landmark can be difficult to
                    visualize in individuals with a poorly defined philtrum. In individuals with clefts of the lip,
                    surgical
                    reconstruction often obscures the landmark. The presence of excessive lipstick and lip liners can
                    also
                    be problematic. Christa philtri is highly susceptible to distortion due to non-neutral facial
                    expressions
                    ; care must be taken to inspect the 3D model prior to landmarking.</p>
                <h5>CHELION (Right and Left)</h5>

                <p><img src=" images/landmark-ch.jpg" width="700" height="175"/></p>

                <p>Chelion (ch) is a bilateral landmark located at the outermost corner (commissure) of the mouth where
                    the upper and lower lips meet. As such, it demarcates the lateral extent of the labial fissure. The
                    landmark is typically placed with the 3D facial model in standard frontal view. In individuals of
                    advanced
                    age, chelion may be difficult to locate due to a loss of structural integrity in the skin at the
                    edge
                    of the mouth. Chelion is highly susceptible to distortion due to non-neutral facial expressions;
                    care
                    must be taken to inspect the 3D model prior to landmarking.</p>
                <h5>TRAGION (Right and Left)</h5>

                <p><img src=" images/landmark-t.jpg" width="700" height="175"/></p>

                <p>Tragion (t) is a bilateral landmark located within the small notch at the superior extent of the
                    tragus
                    (cartilaginous projection just anterior to the auditory meatus), where the cartilage meets the face
                    . The landmark must be placed with the 3D facial model in lateral (profile) view. The presence of
                    even
                    small amounts of hair from the scalp or sideburns can obscure tragion on the 3D model. This is why
                    management of the subject's hair prior to image capture is essential, even though at times the
                    problem
                    is unavoidable. Tragion can sometimes be difficult to visualize on 3D facial models even when the
                    anatomy
                    is not obscured. With certain 3D system configurations, for example, distortion of the ears can
                    occur
                    due to the camera's limited field of view. For this reason, we always recommend pre-marking tragion
                    directly on the subject's face with a water-based skin pen prior to imaging.</p>
                <h5>Landmark Collection Training</h5>

                <p>Individuals responsible for landmarking 3D facial surfaces undergo a two-phase training regimen.
                    In the first phase, the uninitiated trainee is instructed to landmark a standard training set of 10
                    3D facial models with all 24 landmarks. The landmark placement on each 3D model is then reviewed by
                    the PI (Weinberg) and feedback is provided through a one-on-one instruction session. Armed with this
                    feedback, the trainee then begins the second phase. Here they collect the same 24 points twice on a
                    second independent training set of 20 3D facial models, in order to allow for the quantification of
                    the intraobserver error associated with their landmark localization. They are instructed to allow a
                    minimum of 48 hours to pass between the first and second landmarking sessions to minimize recall
                    bias
                    . Once they have completed the landmarking, the associated 3D coordinates are error checked for
                    gross
                    errors (e.g., right-left reversals) and compared across the two sessions. Intraclass correlation
                    coefficients
                    are calculated for each landmark, separately for each of the three principal coordinate axes (x,y,z
                    ). This approach makes it possible to identify any deficiencies in landmark placement in a highly
                    detailed
                    manner, allowing for targeted remediation. Every coefficient must be 0.90 or greater for a trainee
                    to proceed with landmark collection on real data. Additional instruction is provided for trainees
                    who
                    fail any portion of the second phase of training. They may proceed only once they have adequately
                    addressed
                    the deficiency.</p>

                <p>In order to keep landmarking personnel on track, biweekly group meetings are held with the PI
                    (Weinberg
                    ) to review any difficult or confusing cases. These meetings are designed to be informal and
                    educational
                    in nature and are attended by a number of staff and students who are engaged in similar facial
                    landmarking
                    projects. All meeting participants are encouraged keep a running list of any difficulties or
                    uncertainties
                    they encounter during landmarking. Typically, the 3D facial model in question will be called up and
                    the landmark placement openly discussed among the group until the issue is resolved. If corrective
                    action is required, the landmarker is instructed to make the necessary changes and re-save the data
                    . By reviewing everyone's work periodically in this manner, the landmarkers eventually learn how to
                    avoid common problems and make correct judgments in uncertain situations.</p>

                <h3><a id="landmark_distances">Inter-Landmark Distances Derived from 3D Facial Surfaces</a></h3>

                <p>A pre-defined set of 29 linear distances was calculated from each subject's 3D facial landmark
                    coordinates
                    through simple Euclidean geometry. These distances correspond to traditional facial anthropometric
                    measurements as defined by Farkas and others, and were chosen for their clinical relevance and
                    because
                    they comprise a core set of variables for describing general facial form. Of course users are
                    capable
                    of generating any number of alternative inter-landmark distances directly from the raw coordinate
                    data
                    available through the 3D Facial Norms Database.</p>

                <p>Because these 29 measurements are all derived from 3D facial surfaces, caution should be taken before
                    comparing or combining these measurements with those collected using traditional direct
                    anthropometry
                    (i.e., with calipers, rulers and cloth tape). In addition to subtle differences in landmark
                    identification
                    between these two methods, many measurements obtained through direct anthropometry require some
                    degree
                    of deformation - however slight - of the pliable soft tissues of the face with the caliper tips.
                    Obviously
                    , measurements computed from 3D surface models do not involve such deformation. One must be
                    cognizant
                    of these method differences to avoid potential data stratification effects, which could lead to
                    spurious
                    findings. </p>

                <p>Prior to uploading data into the 3D Facial Norms Database, several data cleaning actions were
                    performed
                    .</p>
                <h5>3D Facial Landmark Coordinates</h5>

                <p>The identification of misplaced landmarks (e.g., order errors or right/left reversals) is
                    accomplished
                    by importing each individual's set of x,y,x coordinates into a custom program designed to visually
                    inspect
                    the relative spatial arrangement of landmarks. Each individual's 3D landmarks are projected onto a
                    two dimensional plane and connected with a series of predefined lines creating a wireframe model.
                    The
                    wireframe is designed such that a correctly landmarked face will have no overlapping lines. Inverted
                    or misplaced landmarks are revealed visually when the normal arrangement of line segments is
                    distorted
                    by overlapping lines or abnormal arrangements. </p>

                <p>Additional logic rules are defined that highlight erroneously placed landmarks based on a coordinate
                    component relative to another landmark in the configuration. For example, if midline landmark points
                    are placed on a face in the incorrect order, their relative Y-axis positions can reveal the
                    erroneous
                    landmark. Or consider the inversion of left and right points, the relative X-axis positions will
                    reveal
                    the errors, since the X-value of the left point should always be greater than the right. </p>

                <p>After a landmarking error is discovered, the 3D facial model is re-landmarked and the updated
                    coordinates
                    are re-saved. Another program was developed to automatically collect and assemble every subject's
                    coordinates
                    into a centrally located database. Every time this program is run, it automatically updates the
                    local
                    database with the most recent landmark information.</p>
                <h5>3D Linear Distance and Caliper Measurements</h5>

                <p>To expose potentially erroneous measurements and outliers, Z-scores were calculated for each
                    measurement
                    variable for each individual in the dataset. These scores were calculated relative to other
                    individuals
                    in the dataset with the same sex, ancestry and age. For individuals under 20 years old, measurements
                    were compared within their whole number age group. For individuals 20 years old and older,
                    measurements
                    were compared with individuals +/- 2 years. A filter is applied to select and highlight any
                    measurements
                    with an absolute value Z-score greater than 3. If the measurement was obtained through traditional
                    direct
                    anthropometry, the value was confirmed on the original collection form taken at the time of
                    measurement
                    . If the measurement was derived from 3D landmarks, the landmark positions were verified through
                    visual
                    inspection of the 3D surface model. Any and all incorrect values were fixed and logged.</p>
                <h5>Demographic Data</h5>

                <p>Outlier detection routines were run to identify any potentially erroneous data points. If a
                    problematic
                    value is detected, the data is then verified by cross-checking the original source documents. Any
                    and

                <h3><a id="using_zscore_tool">Using the Z-Score Tool</a></h3>

                <p>Z-scores are commonly used by clinicians to assess where a given individual sits in relation to the
                    general population on some measured aspect of the phenotype. When population-based normative data is
                    available, one is able to determine how many standard deviations an individual is from others of the
                    same age, sex and ancestry. In the craniofacial context, Z-scores can be useful for pre-surgical
                    planning
                    , post-surgical outcome assessment, syndrome delineation, and in some cases, genetic counseling. Now
                    that 3D stereophotogrammetry is becoming quite common in clinical settings, it is essential to be
                    able
                    to produce Z-scores based on measurements obtained with the same technology.</p>

                <p>The simple interactive Z-score tool provided through the 3D Facial Norms Database allows a user to
                    automatically generate Z-scores based on 3D surface measurements. First the user selects the sex,
                    age
                    and ancestry of the individual they are seeking to compare. Then the user selects the measurement of
                    interest. Finally, the user enters the individual's measurement value. The resulting Z-score
                    indicates
                    in standard deviations how this individual compares to his/her peers. The process can then be
                    repeated
                    for additional measurements and/or individuals.</p>

                <p>Like any comparison of this nature, it is essential that the measurement be taken correctly on the
                    individual to be compared in order for the results to be accurate. It is also critical that
                    equivalent
                    methods be used (3D surface anthropometry or traditional direct anthropometry) when conducting such
                    a comparison. Please see the preceding sections describing which methods were used to collect which
                    measurement variables.</p>
